2022 Mathematics Contest in Modeling - Problem C

- There was the price data of gold and Bitcoin for the past 5 years, and the task was to work out the best daily trading
 strategy based on the price data up to that day, and calculate the total income after 5 years when we started with 1000
 dollars.

- Used Rand MATLABtoprocess data, combined empirical mode decomposition(EMD), directed visibility graphs(DVG),
 link prediction, and linear programming to establish the price prediction model and decision-making model, and for each
 day, used them to predict the prices of gold and Bitcoin for the next day and find the best trading strategy.

- Achieved an average annual interest rate of 7.298% in the end.
